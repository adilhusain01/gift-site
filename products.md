#each sections should have different design and way of showing things, cart and likedsection also need to be eloquent and we will use tools like nextjs, tailwind, shadcn, lucidereact, zustand, tanstack query,    zod, framer motion, react hot toast, etc. When user click on checkout in the cart page first he needs to fill name and address, then he clicks checkout (we clear cart), we bring user to his whatsapp app with the neatly formed order message which user will one tap and gets send to the owner of site and voila order done (the site is doing orders through messaging an order to the site owner, simple as that). You can use nodejs and mongo as backend if required but if not do it without it. (Remember use a tool or tech only if we need it. my requirements might not be correct and if you can make the UI or UX better through your imagination, you are good to do that. also add a light and dark theme toggle in navbar)


#The main prompt to you from me is gonna be - less but elegant presentation is better, always
